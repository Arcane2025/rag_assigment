A coaching change often shifts tactics and recruitment priorities. A new coach might prefer a 4-3-3 with wingers, while the old coach used a 3-5-2 with wing-backs. Training intensity can change, affecting fitness and injuries. Players who fit the new system gain minutes, while others may be sold. Leadership and communication matter during transition. Results can improve quickly if the squad matches the coach’s style, but it can also take months to adapt.
