A low block is a defensive approach where the team stays compact near its own penalty area. The goal is to reduce space between defenders and midfielders and force the opponent to cross or shoot from distance. It is effective against teams that rely on through balls. The trade-off is that the team attacks less and depends on counterattacks. A low block needs discipline and clear marking in the box. Fast wingers help transition from defense to attack.
