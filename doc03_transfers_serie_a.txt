Serie A teams are known for structured defending and tactical flexibility. Transfer decisions often prioritize center-backs, wing-backs, and midfielders with strong positioning. Clubs sometimes take advantage of free transfers and experienced players. Loans and conditional obligations to buy are common to control budgets. A team aiming for the Champions League usually adds a reliable goal scorer and increases squad depth for rotation.
