Injuries affect results when key players miss weeks during a crowded schedule. Teams with strong squad depth can rotate without losing quality. A common problem is when both the main striker and backup striker are unavailable. Muscle injuries often increase with high pressing and frequent matches. Medical staff and load management help reduce risk. Coaches may change formation to protect tired players. Depth in midfield and at fullback is crucial over a long season.
