Club finances influence transfer strategy. High wages limit flexibility and make it harder to sign new players. Selling a player can reduce wage bills and fund new arrivals. Financial rules encourage clubs to balance spending with revenue. Smart recruitment includes free transfers and low-cost loans. Champions League qualification can significantly increase income. Some clubs build a sustainable model by developing young players and selling them for profit.
