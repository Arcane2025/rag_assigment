High pressing means trying to win the ball back quickly in the opponent’s half. The front line presses the center-backs and blocks easy passes into midfield. If the press works, the team creates chances close to goal. Pressing requires fitness and coordination, and it can be risky if one player is late. Teams often use triggers like a bad first touch or a pass to the fullback. Good pressing also needs a strong counter-press after losing possession.
