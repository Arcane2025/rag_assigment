Premier League clubs often focus on pace, physical duels, and transitions. In a typical summer window, top teams look for a striker who can finish chances and press from the front. Mid-table clubs prioritize fullbacks and defensive midfielders to protect the back line. A common pattern is buying younger players with high potential and selling veterans to manage wages. Deadlines create short-term loans and late deals. Teams also look for depth to handle a long season with cups.
